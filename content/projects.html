<h2><a href="http://altair-viz.github.io">Altair</a></h2>
<p>Altair is a tool for declarative data visualization in Python, built on
the <a href="http://vega.github.io">Vega</a> ecosystem.</p>
<hr/>

<h2><a href="http://astroml.org">AstroML</a></h2>
<p>AstroML is a Python module for machine learning and data mining in
Astronomy and Astrophysics.  It contains many commonly-used tools from
the astronomical literature, and hundreds of examples of their use.  I
wrote this package to accompany our textbook, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Mining-Machine-Learning-Astronomy/dp/0691151687/" target="tab">Statistics, Data Mining,
and Machine Learning in Astronomy</a></i>.</p>
<hr/>

<h2><a href="http://scikit-learn.org">Scikit-Learn</a></h2>
<p>Scikit-Learn is a powerful and extensive machine learning library
written in Python.  I have
contributed in many areas of the project, but primarily in the area of
generalized N-point problems & manifold learning.</p>
<hr/>

<h2><a href="http://scipy.org">Scipy</a></h2>
<p>Scipy is a collection of Python tools for scientific computing.  My main
contributions have been in the sparse matrix toolkit, primarily in iterative
sparse matrix decompositions and fast graph algorithms.</p>
<hr/>

<h2><a href="http://github.com/jakevdp">Other Packages</a></h2>
<p>I also have made numerous small contributions to projects such as
<a href="http://www.numpy.org">NumPy</a>,
<a href="http://matplotlib.org">Matplotlib</a>,
<a href="http://ipython.org">IPython</a>,
<a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a>,
<a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>,
and others, and have open-sourced much of my other code and teaching materials.
See my <a href="http://github.com/jakevdp">GitHub profile</a> for details.</p>
